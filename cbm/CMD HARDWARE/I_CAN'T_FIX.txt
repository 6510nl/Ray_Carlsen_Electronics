     Due to the unavailabilty of parts and service data, I can't repair the RAMLink
or other CMD products. I have tried in the past but the only source for the proprietary 
information and protected chips is Maurice Randall (click here software), and he is 
unwilling to release anything. There is just nothing I can do about it. 
     I am posting all the information I have collected on these products here.
