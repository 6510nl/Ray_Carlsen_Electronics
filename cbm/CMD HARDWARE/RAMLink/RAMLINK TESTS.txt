                               TESTING THE RAMLINK

RL boots installing its full native partition size as default. To test the RL, 
use RAMTOOLS on the utilities disk to delete the default partition, then make 
a new partition to emulate a 1541, and finally use MCOPY on the disk to copy a 
program over to the 1541 emulation partition. Use device 8 swap button and run 
the program from the RAM disk.
