This RAMLink appears to be the oldest of this group, one with a low serial 
number and a board date of 1990. However, on its ID sticker, it has versions 
C and D scratched out and an E as the identifier. That makes me think it was 
upgraded by CMD at some point. It has the latest DOS ROM V2.01 installed. It 
uses the older 1581 dual-voltage type PS. 

Its SIMM board (date 1992) uses a RTC and has the jumper cut to use 4M SIMMs.
