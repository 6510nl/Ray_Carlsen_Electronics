There are no ID stickers on the GAL chips or DOS EPROM. The main board is the 
later 1992 version, as is the piggyback SIMM RTC board. That board has the 
jumper cut for 4X4M chips (16M RAM). 

This RAMLink unit belongs to Shaun Kleckner in Canada. He sent it to me to
do a modification involving cutting some traces and installing a switch. It's
called a "pass-through port mod". According to info from CMD, the same thing
can be done via a replacement IC, but that's a protected GAL which can't be
copied without the code.
