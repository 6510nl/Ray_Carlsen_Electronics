This RAMLink appears to be a late version with a high serial number and a 
board date of 1992 REV 2C. It has the latest DOS ROM V2.01 and uses the 
later 9VDC 1A PS. 

Its SIMM board (date 1992) uses a RTC and has the jumper cut to use 4M SIMMs.
 
Note: this one was a repair job, cust said power surge. U1 GAL was bad which 
kept the computer from booting. The replacement GAL was a two-IC substitute
from Jeff Jarian which required U1 and U3 be replaced as a matched set: $50.
Note: the mod didn't work as well as the original. Jeff apparently reverse-
engineered the GAL program but it wasn't an exact match. I'll not do that again.
