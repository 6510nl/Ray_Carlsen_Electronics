The SCPU requires the installation of a piggyback board that goes under the MMU chip
in the C128 amd 128D. That CMD OEM board connects to the motherboard CPU U6 via some 
clips. One thing not in the SuperCPU manual is the wire colors for those pigtail clips.

Someone made an after-market Link board that fits under U6 8502 CPU with a socket for 
the connections so clips to the CPU IC pins are no longer necessary. Those clips can 
be unsoldered and the plug wires installed on the MMU baord. Of course the plug wire 
colors are different than on the original mini-clips, so both are shown here.

CLIP WIRES   CPU U6     PLUG WIRES

Black goes  to pin 24    Orange
Green goes  to pin 28    Yellow
Blue goes   to pin 29    White
Yellow goes to pin 30    Red
Red goes    to pin 39    Black

That Link board also has pins so the clips from an original MMU board can be connected
to eliminate the need to access U6 pins with those clips. Such connections to the IC
may cause a short between pins and CMD admitted that it wasn't a very good way to do 
it... the reason the Link board was made.
