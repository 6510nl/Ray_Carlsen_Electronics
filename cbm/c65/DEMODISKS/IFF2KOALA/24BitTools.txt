Three conversion programs to manipulate 24-bit images.  IFF24To8 converts
24-bit IFF images to 8-bit IFF images, Pro2BMP converts 24-bit
3D-Professional format images into 24-bit ".BMP" files that Microsoft
Windows can understand, and Pro2IFF converts 24-bit 3D-Professional format
images into the more useful 24-bit IFF format.
