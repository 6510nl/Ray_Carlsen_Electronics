This package contains programs which are used to convert portable
pixmap (ppm) files to C64 graphics formats (FLI, koala, BFLI) and back
under AmigaOS. The package includes ANSI-C source codes for the programs,
so they are also compilable in any environment with an ANSI compliant
C-compiler. Includes pre-compiled Amiga executables.

C64 viewer programs and some examples are also included.
