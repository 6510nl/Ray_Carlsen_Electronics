DESCRIPTION

     The C64Gfx package contains programs which are used to
     convert portable pixmap (ppm) files to C64 graphics formats
     (FLI and koala) under AmigaOS. The package includes ANSI-C
     source codes for the programs, so they are also compilable
     in any environment with an ANSI compliant C-compiler.

     In addition to this package you need e.g. PBMPlus to convert
     Amiga ilbm files to ppm first. And of course some way to
     transfer files between the machines.


NEW FEATURES

     Better dithering algorithm

     Can output to stdout (used with pipes)

     NTSC version of the FLI viewer program (for C64)


SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     LhA to unpack the archive

     Any C64 to view the results

     Ansi-C compiler to use the converters without Amiga


SUGGESTED ENVIRONMENT

     Amiga with A64 or XT with x1541.exe to transfer the files
     between systems.


PRICE

     Freeware - no donations expected (but of course accepted :-)


DISTRIBUTABILITY

     The package can be freely distributed, provided that the
     contents of the files in the archive are not changed. It
     is allowed to add example files and documentation to the
     package. The author reserves all rights to the sources and
     C64 executables.

     operation of FLI. (ccosun.caltech.edu:pub/rknop/HACKING.MAG/)
